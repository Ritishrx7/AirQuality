# AirQuality

AirQuality is a project aimed at monitoring, analyzing, and visualizing air quality data. The goal is to provide users with real-time and historical insights into air pollution levels using various metrics such as PM2.5, PM10, CO2, NO2, and more. This application can be extended to support IoT devices, multiple data sources, and interactive dashboards.

## Features

- Real-time air quality monitoring
- Historical air quality data visualization
- Support for multiple air quality metrics (PM2.5, PM10, CO2, NO2, etc.)
- Data ingestion from sensors or external APIs
- User-friendly dashboards and charts
- Alerts and notifications for poor air quality
- Export and download data for further analysis

# AirQuality

AirQuality is a project aimed at monitoring, analyzing, and visualizing air quality data. The goal is to provide users with real-time and historical insights into air pollution levels using various metrics such as PM2.5, PM10, CO2, NO2, and more. This application can be extended to support IoT devices, multiple data sources, and interactive dashboards.

## Features

- Historical air quality data visualization
- Support for multiple air quality metrics (PM2.5, PM10, CO2, NO2, etc.)
